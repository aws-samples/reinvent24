# KUB302 | Strategies and Best Practices for Securing Containerized Environments

As part of designing any modern system on AWS, it is necessary to think about the security implications and practices that can affect your security posture. This chalk talk walks you through five key areas to apply best practices for improving the overall security of containerized environments on Amazon EKS using a sample architecture. Learn how to leverage the security footprint on access control, software supply chain, cluster infrastructure, runtime, and data protection.

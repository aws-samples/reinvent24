# KUB320 | Building Modern Data Processing Pipelines on Amazon EKS
Organizations use their data to power everything from financial planning to generative AI. In order to be data-driven, organizations need to build highly scalable, efficient data pipelines to keep up with the rapidly-evolving modern data landscape. In this session, explore how organizations build petabyte-scale data processing pipelines with open source tools such as Apache Spark and AWS-managed services such as Amazon EMR on EKS. Learn the key architecture decisions for storage, networking, and compute that allow you to optimize data pipelines for cost or performance to meet your organizationâ€™s objectives.

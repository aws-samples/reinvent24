# KUB305 | Securing and Observing Amazon EKS Clusters

In this hands-on session, explore how to automate the identification, analysis, and mitigation of risks in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters. Learn how to implement robust security controls—including role-based access control (RBAC), EKS Pod Identity, and service accounts—to apply least-privilege access and secure workload isolation. Also discover how to use AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch to gain deep visibility into EKS cluster activities, enabling real-time monitoring and automated risk detection. Learn the skills to automate risk management processes, helping your Kubernetes workloads remain resilient against evolving threats. You must bring your laptop to participate.

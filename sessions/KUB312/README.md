# KUB312 | Automated Cluster Infrastructure with Amazon EKS and Karpenter
Kubernetes makes building and running complex applications simpler, but using Kubernetes comes with a unique set of challenges, such as security, networking, interoperability, storage, and scaling. Amazon EKS eliminates the need to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control planes, alleviating many challenges, but responding quickly to new workload requirements while balancing cost and performance can be difficult. In this session, learn how Karpenter and newly launched Amazon EKS Auto Mode simplify managing your Amazon EKS cluster, from cluster creation and running your application to day 2 operations and everything in between.

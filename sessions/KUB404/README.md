# KUB404 | Building Production-Grade Resilient Architectures with Amazon EKS

Platform teams need to effectively manage thousands of clusters to meet the demands of growing organizations. In this session, learn how to manage and upgrade clusters at scale without compromising security, resiliency, performance, and cost. See how you can use open source tools like ACK, Argo CD, and Backstage to build and maintain Amazon EKS clusters at scale, as well as provide a single pane of glass as an inventory of Amazon EKS clusters across your entire AWS organization. Explore architecture techniques to ensure workload resiliency with enhanced observability, enabling rapid issue identification across Amazon EKS clusters.

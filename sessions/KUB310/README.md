# KUB310 | Amazon EKS for Edge and Hybrid Use Cases
Some workloads need to run on premises, at the edge, or in a hybrid scenario due to low latency, data dependencies, data sovereignty, and other regulatory reasons, especially in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, telecommunications, and financial services. Data-dependent workloads may have to wait for data to be in AWS services before they can be fully migrated. In this session, explore production-ready architectures using Amazon EKS Anywhere and Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes to run container workloads on premises and support modernizing VMware-based workloads.

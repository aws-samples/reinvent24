# KUB405 | Amazon EKS as Data Platform for Analytics
As running analytics workloads on Amazon EKS continues to rise, data engineers need self-service tools to create infrastructure for running analytics jobs. This session offers practical insights into how leading organizations are modernizing their data platforms, transitioning from traditional infrastructure as code pipelines to infrastructure as Kubernetes APIs. Using open source technologies like AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK), data platform teams can help data engineers create on-demand namespaces and clusters fully equipped to run analytics jobs, thereby streamlining their workflow.
